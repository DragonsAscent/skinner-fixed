# Skinner (Fixed)
I do not own this plugin nor do I take credit. I simply needed to change the fact that it kills all mobs upon the plugin starting. Original links are below.
- **Spigot Page**: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/skinner.59452/
- **Bit Bucket**: http://sndev.it:7990/projects/SN/repos/skinner/browse

This plugins is meant for private use and I will not be releasing builds.
